Atlas Tracker is the private, secure way to track your supplement, peptide, and compound regimen. Designed for people who take their health seriously, Atlas gives you the tools to stay consistent, organized, and informed.

KEY FEATURES

- Smart Dose Scheduling: Set up daily, weekly, or custom schedules for each compound. Get reminders so you never miss a dose.

- Visual Injection Site Rotation: Interactive body maps for both IM and subcutaneous injections. Atlas recommends your next injection site based on rotation history to prevent tissue buildup.

- Dose Logging & History: Tap to log each dose with amount, injection site, and notes. Edit or delete entries anytime. View your complete history with analytics.

- Analytics Dashboard: Track adherence rates, dose frequency charts, compound breakdowns, and weight trends over time. See weekly, monthly, and all-time stats at a glance.

- Inventory Management: Monitor your supply levels. Get low stock alerts before you run out.

- Weight Tracking: Log weight entries manually or import from Apple Health. Track trends alongside your compound regimen.

- CSV Export: Export your complete dose history for your records or to share with your healthcare provider.
